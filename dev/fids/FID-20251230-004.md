**Created:** 2025-12-30
**Completed:** 2025-12-30

## Description
Create a beautiful, dynamic, and scalable help command system that automatically discovers commands and organizes them by category with interactive navigation.

## Requirements
- [x] Dynamic command discovery (auto-detects all registered commands)
- [x] Category-based organization with icons
- [x] Interactive navigation (select menu + back button)
- [x] Individual command details on selection
- [x] Beautiful embeds with consistent styling
- [x] Scales automatically as commands are added
- [x] Permission-aware (only shows commands user can access)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/config/categories.js` - Category definitions (28 LOC)
- `src/utils/helpBuilder.js` - Help UI utilities (195 LOC)
- `src/commands/utility/help.js` - Rewritten command (29 LOC)
- `src/events/interactionCreate.js` - Added help handlers (+35 LOC)

## Total LOC: ~287 new

## Features
- **Main Menu:** Shows all categories with emoji, description, command count
- **Category View:** Lists all commands in category with subcommand support
- **Command Detail:** Shows full command info, options, subcommands
- **Back Button:** Returns to main menu from any view
- **Permission Filter:** Hides admin commands from non-admins

## Scalability
- Add new category: Just add to `src/config/categories.js`
- Add new command: Just set `category` property - auto-discovered
- No hardcoded command lists

## Estimation
- Estimated: 45m
- Actual: ~20m
